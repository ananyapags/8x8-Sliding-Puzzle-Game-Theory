# 8x8-Sliding-Puzzle-Game-Theory

- This project was the ultimate test of my knowledge of Python and PyGame.
- The goal was to create an unbeatable AI for an 8 by 8 puzzle slider game. I wanted to not only untangle the puzzle but do so in the least amount of steps.
- For me, this project was a great way to challenge my understanding of Game theory on a bigger scale. It helped me appreciate the nitpicky aspects behind creating a successful Artificial Intelligence.
- I would say the most exciting part of this project was understanding the best algorithm to traverse the game trees. My original plan was to simply look for the shortest path to the bottom of a Game Tree based on the possible moves, but I soon realized that was not best for the time complexity of my program. With my then-current toolbox, I really couldn't think of anything more efficient. So I took this as an opportunity to learn new and possibly more effective algorithms like heuristic searching and A\*!
